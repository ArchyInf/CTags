== CTags ==

This [[http://sublimetext.com|SublimeText]] Package provides support for working with tags generated by [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/|Exuberant CTags]]

A copy of ctags.exe is included and it works by doing a binary search
of an mmap()'d `tags` file so it will work efficiently with very large (
50MB+ etc ) tags files if needed.

=== Dependencies ===

* This package depends on [[http://bitbucket.org/sublimator/aaaloadfirstextensions/|AAALoadFirstExtensions]]

=== Installation ===

BitBucket uniformly lower cases the urls so you must explicitly set the clone destination to the proper package name.

* $ cd %APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages
* $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/sublimator/ctags/ CTags

=== About ===

See this [[http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=144|forum thread]] for a bit of background.

=== Usage ===

This uses `tags` files created in `ctags -R` recursive mode.

The commands will try and find a `tags` file in the same directory as
the current view, walking up directories until it finds one. If it
can't find one it will offer to build some ( in the directory of the
current view )

If a symbol can't be found in a tags file it will search in
alternative locations.

If you create a file `tags_search_paths` in the same folder as your
`tags` file, listing alternative locations (full absolute paths, one
per line) it will search those files also.

eg 

{{{
D:\myProject\tags
C:\Python25\Lib\tags
}}}

=== Other Settings ===

If you create a file `local_settings.py` inside the checkout directory
you can over-ride these default settings. Check the [[http://bitbucket.org/sublimator/ctags/src/tip/ctags_plugin.py|ctags_plugin.py]]
for all possibilities.

{{{
#!python
# over ride this if you want to change the ctags command to exclude some languages for example
CTAGS_CMD = [CTAGS_EXE, '-R']

# Fallback path if dict key matches scope of current view.
# By default if a symbol can't be found for a python file it will check the stdlib (if the path exists)
TAGS_PATHS = {
    'source.python' :  r'C:\Python25\Lib\tags',
}
}}}

=== Support ===

If there are any problems or you have a suggestion [[http://bitbucket.org/sublimator/ctags/issues/new/|open an issue]] and I will receive an email notification.

Thanks :)
